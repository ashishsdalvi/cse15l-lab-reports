**Installing VSCode** 

Go to the VSCode website and download the version for your respective operating system. I already have VSCode installing on my mac but your download page should look something like this.

Once you are finished downloading, go to the next step listed below. 


**Remotely Connecting**

Once you are in VSCode, open up a terminal.

In your terminal, type: ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu

Replace zz with the 3 letters corresponding to your specific CSE 15L student account. 

You will then be prompted to enter a password. After entering the password, you will be remotely connected to the server 
and some stats will be displayed. 

Your page should look similar to this image.

Once you are finished, try running some commands!

**Trying Some Commands**

Some commands you can try are ls, pwd, cd and you can add various flags to these commands as well (Ex: ls -lah)

Here is some of the output from my commands.
